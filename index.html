<p>
  <a href="{{site.swc_site}}">Software Carpentry</a>'s mission
  is to help scientists and engineers get more research done in less
  time and with less pain by teaching them basic lab skills for
  scientific computing.  This one-day 
  <a href="http://www.uio.no/english/for-employees/support/research/research-data/training/carpentry/">Carpentry@UiO</a> 
  hands-on workshop will cover 
  the version control using git lesson of Software Carpentry.

        The default shell in all versions of Mac OS X is Bash, so no
        need to install anything.  You access Bash from the Terminal
        (found in
        <code>/Applications/Utilities</code>).
        See the Git installation <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LQhwETCdwY ">video tutorial</a>

  <h3>Git</h3>
  <p>
    Git is a version control system that lets you track who made changes
    to what when and has options for easily updating a shared or public
    version of your code
    on <a href="https://github.com/">github.com</a>. You will need a
    <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/supported-browsers/">supported</a>
    web browser (current versions of Chrome, Firefox or Safari,
    or Internet Explorer version 9 or above).
  </p>
  <p>
    You will need an account at <a href="https://github.com/">github.com</a>
    for parts of the Git lesson. Basic GitHub accounts are free. We encourage
    you to create a GitHub account if you don't have one already.
    Please consider what personal information you'd like to reveal. For
    example, you may want to review these
    <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/keeping-your-email-address-private/">instructions
    for keeping your email address private</a> provided at GitHub.

        <strong>For OS X 10.9 and higher</strong>, install Git for Mac
        by downloading and running the most recent "mavericks" installer from
        <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/git-osx-installer/files/">this list</a>.
        After installing Git, there will not be anything in your <code>/Applications</code> folder,
        as Git is a command line program.
        <strong>For older versions of OS X (10.5-10.8)</strong> use the
        most recent available installer labelled "snow-leopard"
        <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/git-osx-installer/files/">available here</a>.

  <h3>Text Editor</h3>

  <p>
    When you're writing code, it's nice to have a text editor that is
    optimized for writing code, with features like automatic
    color-coding of key words.  The default text editor on Mac OS X and
    Linux is usually set to Vim, which is not famous for being
    intuitive.  if you accidentally find yourself stuck in it, try
    typing the escape key, followed by <code>:q!</code> (colon, lower-case 'q',
    exclamation mark), then hitting Return to return to the shell.
